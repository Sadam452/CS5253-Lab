# Wormhole Attack

This repository contains the solutions for the following tasks related to graph algorithms:

1. **Shortest Paths Between All Pairs of Nodes:**
   - Implementation of an algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a given weighted graph. This task aims to implement an algorithm for finding shortest paths efficiently.

2. **Diameter Calculation Before and After Wormhole Attack:**
   - Analysis of the diameter of a given graph both before and after a wormhole attack is injected. This task involves studying the impact of network attacks on the overall structure of a graph and how it affects the diameter. It shows how a wormhole attack can be detacted.

## Requirements
- c++

## Usage

### Shortest Paths Between All Pairs of Nodes & wormhole detection
