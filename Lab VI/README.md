# Client-Server Architecture with Multi-Client Communication

This program demonstrates a simple implementation of a client-server architecture where multiple clients can communicate with a single server. The communication between clients is facilitated through the server. Multithreading is used.

## Overview

In this architecture, the server acts as a central point that manages connections and facilitates communication between multiple clients. Clients can send requests or messages to the server, which can handle multiple requests using multi-threading.

## Features

- **Single Server**: One central server manages all client connections.
- **Multi-Client Support**: Multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously.
- **Communication**: Clients cserver bi-directional communication.
